# QualitySense

QualitySense is a data quality checker assistant designed to help users identify missing values, outliers, categorical errors, and potential misspellings in their datasets. Powered by AI, the app not only detects these issues but also generates a Data Quality Summary Report that includes actionable suggestions. This dual capability provides valuable insights, enabling users to make informed decisions more effectively while enhancing overall data quality.

## API Throttling

To ensure optimal performance and reliability, the Generate page implements an API throttling mechanism. Users are allowed to make **up to 2 requests per minute**. This limit is set to comply with the capabilities of the Gemini AI service, which can handle a maximum of **15 requests per minute** overall. 

### Throttling Details:

- **Requests Allowed**: 2 requests per user per minute

- **Reason**: To prevent overwhelming the Gemini API and ensure fair usage among all users

- **Response to Excess Requests**: If the request limit is exceeded, users will receive a notification indicating that they have reached the maximum number of allowed requests. Users should wait before making additional requests.
